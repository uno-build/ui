## RendererWebGPU opacity

`RendererWebGPU` implements `opacity` as a simple accumulated alpha factor per
node. A node's effective opacity is multiplied by the opacity of its ancestors
and applied to each drawable rectangle.

This does not match CSS group opacity when descendants overlap. DOM renderers
first composite the whole subtree and then apply opacity to that result; the
WebGPU renderer applies opacity to each node independently. In overlapping
areas, WebGPU can therefore look different from DOM.

Until WebGPU supports offscreen subtree compositing for opacity, layout examples
and visual comparisons should avoid overlapping descendants inside nodes with
`opacity < 1`.

## RendererWebGPU overflow and border radius

`RendererWebGPU` clips overflowing descendants with rectangular ancestor bounds.
It does not include an ancestor's `borderRadius` in the clipping shape.

This differs from CSS when a node combines `overflow: hidden` or
`overflow: scroll` with rounded corners. DOM renderers clip descendants to the
rounded border box, while WebGPU clips them to the node's rectangular layout
box. Descendants can therefore remain visible in rounded corner areas where DOM
would clip them away.

Until WebGPU supports rounded ancestor clipping, layout examples and visual
comparisons should avoid relying on `borderRadius` to clip overflowing
descendants.
